# Community Forum Structure

## Categories
- **General**: cross-cutting announcements, platform updates, and off-topic discussion.
- **Project-specific**: each live project receives a tag for scoped feedback/bug reports.
- **Training**: share study guides, ask clarifying questions about onboarding modules.
- **Feedback**: requests for new features, policy improvements, or UX tweaks.

## Threads & Replies
- Each category hosts threaded conversations with chronological replies.
- Thread metadata includes author, timestamps, project tag, and solved indicators.

## Voting & Moderation
