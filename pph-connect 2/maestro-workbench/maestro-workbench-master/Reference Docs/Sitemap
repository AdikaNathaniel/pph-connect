##How it should be (actual URLS, not necessarily the logic and layout application etc)
#guiding principles:
- there is a manager UI side and a worker UI side
- only the login and auth pages are shared between the two sides
- everything for the manager side must be be behind a /m/ URL
- everything for the worker side must be be behind a /w/ URL
Issue: Currently pages are all over. Some are behind /manager and others are not.

Ideal Sitemap
/ = landing page
/auth = landing page without pre selection of role
/w = worker auth page
/m = manager auth page

Manager side:
/m/dashboard = manager dashboard (this is the default page for the manager side, if logged in as manager)
/m/analytics = manager stats page (same as analytics links)
/m/projects = manager projects page (same as projects links) content tbd
    m/projects/new This should take you to the current /new-project page
/m/users = manager users page (the current /manager/users page should be here)
/m/assignments = manager assignments page (the current /manager/assignments page should be here)
/m/plugins = manager plugins page  (the current /plugins page should be here. )
    /m/plugins/new The current /plugins/new should be here.

Current /questions/(…project id) should follow new logic: /m/projects/questions/(…project id)

Worker side:
/w/dashboard (the current /dashboard shows this when logged in as a worker. Must be separated at URL level!)
    This page should allow them to launch the workbench. This way, they can log in without having the timer start right away.
    The "Launch Question" button should take them to the workbench:
/w/workbench:
    This page currently is still caleed /dashboard when logged in as a worker. Must be a whole other URL and page!
    This loads the project (plugin assigned to project plus tasks according to completed/pending project task data)
/w/analytics
    This page is currently already /analytics when logged in as a worker. Must be a whole other URL and page!
