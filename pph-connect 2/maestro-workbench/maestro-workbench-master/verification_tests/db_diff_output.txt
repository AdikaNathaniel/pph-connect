DB Diff output shows all the messaging schema is MISSING from current database.
The migrations exist but haven't been applied yet.

Migrations seen:
- 20251029110039_messaging_permission_helpers.sql
- 20251029110040_extend_user_roles.sql (notes: enum values already exist)
- 202510291100441_add_organizational_structure.sql
- 20251029110042_create_messaging_tables.sql
- 20251029110043_messaging_rls_policies.sql
- 20251029110044_message_attachments_storage.sql

Status: Migrations exist in files but NOT applied to local database yet.
Need to check why migrations 110039-110044 weren't applied during db reset.
